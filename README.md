Todo List App

This project is a simple yet feature-rich Todo List application built using React.js. The app allows users to add tasks with specific due dates and times, manage task statuses (active, completed, overdue), and filter tasks by their state. It also tracks the remaining time for each task and highlights urgent or overdue tasks.


Features

. Add Tasks: Users can add tasks with a description, due date, and time.

. Task Filtering: Filter tasks by "All", "Active", or "Completed".

. Task Management: Mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and track time left until tasks are due.

. Time Management: Displays how much time is left for each task, and highlights tasks as "urgent" or "overdue" based on their due date/time.

. Responsive UI: The interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with a modern, clean look.
